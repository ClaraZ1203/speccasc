" This is a classic math problem. Here's how to solve it:

* **Great Grandma's children:** 3 children
* **Great Grandchildren:** 3 children * 3 grandchildren = 9 grandchildren
* **Great Great Grandbabies:** 9 grandchildren * 3 babies = 27 great-great-grandchildren

**Total:** 3 + 9 + 27 = **39**

" Tyson runs 5000 meters each day. His coach wants him to run 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 more meters. 5000 + 1000 = 6000. So he ran a total of 6000 meters in a month.

" Craig started with 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  He buys 6 x 2 = 12 dollars worth of squirt guns. 3 x 3 = 9 dollars worth of water balloons. So he spent 12 + 9 = 21 dollars. Craig has 40 - 21 = 19 dollars left. The answer is 19.

" Let's represent the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. Four times the number of coffee mugs is 4x. Eight more than that is 4x + 8. The problem states that this is equal to 40. So, 4x + 8 = 40.  Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 4x = 32. Dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = 8. So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

" Ford grows 40 roses per week. Each shop orders 20, 15 and 30 roses weekly. That is a total of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week. So Ford has to supply 65 roses per week - 40 roses per week = 25 roses to supply all the shops every week.

" This is a fun math problem! Here's how to solve it:
* **Great Grandma's children:** 3 children
* **Great Grandma's grandchildren:** 3 * 3 = 9 grandchildren
* **Great Grandma's great-grandchildren:** 9 * 3 = 27 great-grandchildren 

Great Grandma Jones has a total of 27 great-grandbabies!

" Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more, which is 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 more meters. So he runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters in a day. If he trains for a month, that would be 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters. The answer is 180,000.

These are just a few examples. I can create more if you'd like!

" Let’s say the number of coffee mugs is “x”.  Four times the number of mugs is 4x. Eight more than that is 4x + 8. We know this equals 40, so we have the equation: 4x + 8 = 40.  Solving for x: 4x = 32, so x = 8.  The answer is 8.

" Ford grows 40 roses per week. The first flower shop orders 20 roses. The second flower shop orders 15 roses. The third flower shop orders 30 roses. So that is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. Ford has to supply 65 roses. He grows 40 roses every week. So he has 65 - 40 = 25 roses left. The answer is 25.

" Tyson runs 5000 meters each day. His coach wants him to run 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters more. So his total distance for the day is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters. He runs for a month, so that means 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters. The answer is 180,000 meters.
