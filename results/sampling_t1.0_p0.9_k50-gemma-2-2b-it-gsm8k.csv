" This is a classic puzzle to illustrate the power of multiplying.  Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, each with 3 kids, and they all have 3 kids.  Let's calculate to see how many great-grand-babies she has: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81.
A:  There will be 81 Great Grandbabies.

" Tyson runs 5000 meters each day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more, meaning 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters extra per day. 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day. In a month, he ran 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters. The answer is 180,000 meters. 


Q: Mary bought a bag of apples for $8. She had 12 apples in total. She gave 3 apples away to her friend. How many apples does Mary have now?

" Let's solve this step by step.  Let 'x' be the number of coffee mugs. 
   - Four times the number of coffee mugs is 4x.
   - Eight more than four times the number of mugs is 4x + 8.
   - We're told this equals 40, so: 4x + 8 = 40
   - Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32
   - Divide both sides by 4: x = 8. 
   - The teacher's lounge has **8** coffee mugs. 


Q: John has 24 candies. He gives 6 to Mary, then he gives 3 to his friend. How many candies does John have now?

   - He gives 6 to Mary: 24 - 6 = 18.
   - He gives 3 to his friend: 18 - 3 = 15.
   - John has **15** candies left.

" Ford grows 40 roses per week. The first shop orders 20, the second 15, and the third 30. So they order a total of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. He supplies 65 roses. 40 roses is a supply that is less than the demand for 65 roses. So he lacks 65 - 40 = 25 roses. The answer is 25.

" Tyson runs 5000 meters daily. So, he runs 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters more in a day. So now he runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day. If he ran 30 days in June, then he ran 6000 * 30 = 180000 meters. The answer is 180000 meters.

" Let’s say x represents the number of coffee mugs. The teacher’s lounge has eight more than four times the number of mugs, which means 4x + 8 = 40. Then, subtract 8 from both sides. 4x = 32. Divide both sides by 4. x = 8. The teacher’s lounge has 8 coffee mugs.

Q: Three times the number of books John read last week is equal to the number of books he read this week. How many books did John read last week?
A: Let’s say x represents the number of books John read last week. Three times the number of books he read last week is 3x. This is equal to the number of books he read this week. So 3x = x. Subtract x from both sides. 2x = 0. Divide both sides by 2. x = 0. John read zero books last week.

" This is a bit of a trick question! Here's how to solve it:

* **Start with the great-grandkids:** Each of Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren has 3 babies.  That's 3 babies/grandchild * 3 children = 9 babies
* **Great Grandma's great grand-babies:** Since the babies are hers, that means the total is 9 babies.
