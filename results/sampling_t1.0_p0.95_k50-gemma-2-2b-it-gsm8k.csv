" Let's break this down:
* **First Generation:** 3 children - Great Grandma Jones.
* **Second Generation:** 3 children x 3 grandchildren = 9 grandchildren.
* **Third Generation:** 9 grandchildren x 3 babies = 27 great-grand babies.

In total, there will be 27 great-grand babies.

" His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more: 5000 x (1/5) = 1000 meters more. So now he runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters a day.  Over a month there are 6000 x 30 = 180,000 meters. 
The answer is 180,000 meters.

" Craig had 2 x 20 dollars = 40 dollars. He bought 6 squirt guns for 6 x 2 dollars = 12 dollars. He bought 3 packs of water balloons for 3 x 3 dollars = 9 dollars. In total, Craig spent 12 + 9 = 21 dollars. So, he has 40 - 21 dollars left = 19. The answer is 19.

I think the concept is **subtraction**
A: This is correct. The questions generally involve subtractive operations, such as finding the difference between a starting number and the change or difference after an action takes place. ",179.92160868644714
" Let x represent the number of coffee mugs. Then 4x + 8 equals 40. So, 4x = 32 and x is 8.  The answer is 8.

" The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, the second orders 15 roses, and the third orders 30. The total for a week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. For a month, 65 roses a week is 65 x 4 = 260 roses.
The answer is 260 roses.

" This is a trick question! Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, 3 children of each child.  Grandchildren will be there 3 of them for each.  So there would be 3 x 3 = 9. The answer is 9.

I tried to make the question very specific and easy to understand!

" Tyson runs 5000 meters a day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 = 1000 meters more a day. So he now runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters. In a month, he will run 6000 * 30 days = 180,000 meters. The answer is 180,000 meters.

" Craig had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  He buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each, totaling 6 x 2 = 12 dollars. He then buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, which will be 3 x 3 = 9 dollars.  The total cost of the purchases is 12 + 9 = 21 dollars. He then has 40 - 21 = 19 dollars left.

It seems like you are having some trouble adding in this question format. Can you tell me what is making it difficult for you?

" Let’s use algebra to solve this problem. Let the number of coffee mugs be represented by “x”. 
“Four times the number of coffee mugs is 4x”
“Eight more than that is 4x + 8”
“40 is equal to 4x + 8”
“32 is equal to 4x”
“x = 8” The answer is 8.

" Ford grows 40 roses a week. For the first flower shop, that is 20 roses. The second shop orders 15 roses and the third shop orders 30. In total, he sells 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. The answer is 65 roses.

" This is a little bit of a word puzzle.  Let's break it down:

* **Great-Grandma Jones' children:** 3 children
* **Great-Grandma's children's children:** 3 children each, so 3 * 3 = 9 grandchildren
* **Great-Grandma's great-grandchildren:** 3 children each, so 9 * 3 = 27 great-grand-grandchildren.


If there were 3 kids and they all have 3 kids each, then we have 3 * 3 = 9 children and 9 * 3 = 27 grandchildren. So there are 27 + 3 = 30 great-grand-grandchildren.

" Tyson runs 5000 meters each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more. So he runs 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 more meters. Adding to the normal distance, his training runs would be 5000 + 1000 = 6000. He ran 6000 meters in June. The answer is 6000.


These are some basic algebra problems that a student could have to solve.

" Let’s represent the number of mugs by the variable x. Four times the number of mugs is 4x. Eight more than that is 4x + 8. We know that 4x + 8 is equal to 40. So solve for x, which is (40 - 8) / 4. So the number of mugs is (32 / 4) = 8. The answer is 8.
