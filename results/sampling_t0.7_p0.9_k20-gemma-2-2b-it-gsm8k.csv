" Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, and each child has 3 children, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 grandchildren.  Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies, so there are 9 * 3 = 27 great grand-babies. The answer is 27.

" Tyson runs 5000 meters per day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more, which is 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 more meters. So he now runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day. 
In a month, he covers 6000 * 30 = 180000 meters. The answer is 180000.

" Craig had 2 twenty dollar bills. That is 2 * 20 = 40 dollars. He buys 6 squirt guns for 6 * 2 = 12 dollars. He buys 3 packs of water balloons for 3 * 3 = 9 dollars. So his total spending is 12 + 9 = 21 dollars. Craig has 40 - 21 = 19 dollars left. The answer is 19.

" Let’s call the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge 'x'. Four times the number of coffee mugs is 4x. Eight more than that is 4x + 8. We know that 4x + 8 = 40. So 4x = 32. Then x = 8. The answer is 8. 

Q: John has 12 apples. He gives 3 to his friend. How many apples does he have left?
A: John started with 12 apples. He gave 3 to his friend. So he has 12 - 3 = 9 apples left. The answer is 9.

" Let's call the number of coffee mugs ""x"". Four times the number of coffee mugs is 4x. Eight more than that is 4x + 8. We know this is equal to 40. So 4x + 8 = 40. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 4x = 32. Dividing both sides by 4, we find x = 8. The teacher's lounge has 8 coffee mugs.

" Let’s think about this problem step-by-step. Let’s say there are ‘x’ coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge. Then, four times the number of coffee mugs is 4x. Eight more than that is 4x + 8. The problem says that this is equal to 40. So, we can write the equation: 4x + 8 = 40. Solving for x, we get 4x = 32, so x = 8. The answer is 8.
