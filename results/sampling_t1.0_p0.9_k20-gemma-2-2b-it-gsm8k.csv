" Ford grows 40 roses per week. The first shop orders 20, the second shop orders 15, the third shop orders 30. So a total of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses were ordered. So he has to supply 40 roses per week * 4 weeks = 160 roses for all the flower shops. He needs to supply 160 - 65 = 95 roses. The answer is 95.

" Let’s use a variable for the number of coffee mugs. Let that be “x”. The problem is stating that: 8 more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation: 4x + 8 = 40. 
* Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32
* Divide both sides by 4: x = 8. The answer is 8.
