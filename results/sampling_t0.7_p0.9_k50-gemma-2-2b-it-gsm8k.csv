" This is a classic counting problem! Here's how to solve it:

* **Great Grandma's children:** 3 children
* **Great Grandma's grandchildren:** 3 children/grandchild * 3 grandchildren = 9 grandchildren
* **Great Grandma's great-grandchildren:** 3 children/great-grandchild * 9 great-grandchildren = 27 great-grandchildren

**Total great-grandbabies:** 3 + 9 + 27 = 39

Great Grandma Jones will have 39 great-grandbabies to kiss.

" Tyson runs 5000 meters per day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more, which is 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 more meters. So his new distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day. In a month, he covers 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters. The answer is 180,000 meters.

These are just a few examples.

" Let’s represent the number of coffee mugs as “x”. Four times the number of mugs is 4x. Eight more than that is 4x + 8. The problem states that this is equal to 40. So 4x + 8 = 40.  Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us 4x = 32. Dividing both sides by 4 gives us x = 8. The answer is 8.
