" Let's break this down step-by-step:

* Great Grandma Jones' children have three children each: 3 children
* Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren: 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren
* Great Grandma Jones' great-grandchildren: 9 x 3 = 27 great-grandchildren
 
There will be a total of 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss at the reunion.

" Tyson runs 5000 meters per day. He will run 5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters more. 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters. He ran 6000 meters in a month, which is 6000 x 30 = 180000 meters. The answer is 180000.

" Craig has 2 x 20 dollars, which is $40. He then spent on squirt guns, $6 x 2 dollars = $12.  He also spent $3 x 3 dollars = $9.  So the total spent is $12 + $9 = $21. Craig had $40 and spent $21, so he has $40 - $21 = 19 left.

" Let the number of coffee mugs be 'x'. Four times the number of mugs is 4x. Eight more than 4x is 4x + 8. Since this is equal to 40, we have the equation: 4x + 8 = 40. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us 4x = 32. Dividing both sides by 4 gives us x = 8. Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

Q: A baker made 24 cookies. He then sold 12 of them. How many cookies does he have left?

"  Ford grows 40 roses each week. The first flower shop takes 20. The second takes 15. The third takes 30. That's a total of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. Ford has 40 roses - 65 roses = -25. That means Ford has to grow 25 roses to satisfy all three shops.
The answer is 25

" This is a classic counting problem that follows a simple pattern. Here's how to solve it:

* **Great-Grandma's children:** 3 children
* **Children's children:** 3 children each, so 3 * 3 = 9 great-grandchildren
* **Great-grandchildren's children:** 3 children each, so 3 * 9 = 27 great-great-grandchildren

**Total:** 3 + 9 + 27 = 39 great-grand-babies

" Tyson runs 5000 meters a day. His coach wants him to run 5000 x (1/5) = 1000 more meters. That is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters. Tyson would run 6000 meters in a day. So, over a month there are 6000 x 30 = 180000 meters covered in June. The answer is 180000.

" Craig started with 2 x 20 = 40 dollars. He spent 6 x 2 = 12 dollars on squirt guns. He spent 3 x 3 = 9 dollars on water balloons. In total, he spent 12 + 9 = 21 dollars. So he has 40 - 21 = 19 dollars left.

" Let x represent the number of coffee mugs. Four times the number of coffee mugs is 4x. Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 4x + 8. We know that this is equal to 40. So 4x + 8 = 40. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 4x = 32. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 8. So there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

" Ford grows 40 roses each week. The first shop orders 20, second orders 15 and the third 30. In total, 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses were ordered. Ford has 40 roses. So he needs 65 - 40 = 25 roses to supply all the flower shops. 25 roses needed to be supplied.

" This is an easy problem!  The children of one of your parents are your siblings. Your siblings kids are your nieces and nephews. Your nieces and nephews kids are your great nephews and nieces. If the Great Grandma Jones has 3 children who have 3 children each and so on. There will be the same number of great-grand babies as the number of children of her children. 

This is a great problem for people who love family trees.

" Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 = 1000 more meters. So he needs to run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

" Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, totaling 2 * 20 = 40 dollars. He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, costing 6 * 2 = 12 dollars. He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, costing 3 * 3 = 9 dollars. The total cost is 12 + 9 = 21 dollars. So he has 40 - 21 = 19 dollars left. The answer is 19.
